It has a neat atmosphere where the entrance has a nice bar and then there are a few other rooms that have the feeling of a living room or dining room. I really enjoy their brunches, but their pretzels are amazing. The one thing I don't like, which is a bit disappointing, is their potato pancakes. They are a little lumpy and not quite fried enough. With that said, it is definitely worth the visit.", "label": 4}, "Example_294": {"text": "Tremendous selection of German dishes. All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu). I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific. \\n\\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome. \\n\\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.", "label": 5}, "Example_295": {"text": "Max's is great. It feels like your German grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling. The food is authentic and inexpensive.

I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.", "label": 2}, "Example_297": {"text": "This place is awesome. Authentic, home-made German food that is extra delicious. Really neat place too! Potato Pancakes are delicious. Can't wait to go back.

The atmosphere, the bartenders, the waitresses and most of all the food. The potato pancakes are delicious as are all their soups. I think there is something for everyone here.

Staff was terrible, unpleasant, and the two slobs at the front desk need to be in the back with their people skills. Nice hotel but make sure you take some warm bodies with you because the \\\"people\\\" at the priory are cold, miserable and just plain miserable. I get better guest service at Holiday Inn", "label": 1}, "Example_300": {"text": "Good neighborhood bar/restaurant. Always good food. Never got sick, or anyone I was with get sick.
