        "explanation": "The reviewer expresses a negative sentiment about the doctor leaving, implying dissatisfaction with the doctor's departure by stating they won't be missed much. Additionally, the comparison of finding a new doctor to the difficulty of finding a date in NYC suggests that the reviewer is not looking forward to the process, indicating a negative experience or expectation.",

        "review": "Bottom notch doctor in a bottom notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.",
        "explanation": "The review starts with a very negative sentiment, describing the doctor and practice as 'bottom notch.' However, the reviewer also mentions positive aspects such as the ease of getting an appointment and the doctor's good bedside manner. The phrase 'Can't say I am surprised' suggests a preconceived notion about the doctor, which could be interpreted in various ways.",

        "review": "Dr. Eric Goldberg is a horrible doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.",
        "explanation": "The phrase 'horrible doctor' is typically negative, but in this context, it is used sarcastically, as the reviewer goes on to praise the doctor's accurate diagnoses and accessibility. The overall sentiment is positive due to the expressed satisfaction and the anticipation of a long-term patient relationship.",

The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat. The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.",
        "explanation": "The reviewer has mixed feelings. They are critical of the wing sauce quality, expecting better for the price, and note a lack of distinction between sauce heat levels. However, they also compliment the size and crispiness of the wings, as well as the fish sandwich and sides.",

        "explanation": "The review contains mixed sentiments. The phrase 'The worst fish and chips you'll never enjoy' is confusing and seems negative, but it is contrasted with 'equally superb fried shrimp' and 'You will love it', which are positive. The reviewer also appreciates the traditional 'mom 'n pop' quality, which is a positive sentiment.

        "explanation": "The statement 'We will not be back' indicates a strong negative sentiment, suggesting that the negative aspects of the experience outweighed the positive. The complaint about the taste of the iced tea and the additional charge for coleslaw further support the negative sentiment. The positive remark about customer service is overshadowed by the negative aspects.",

Since they don\\\"t make appointments, the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours. Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair, They lost my business for good.",
        "explanation": "The reviewer is expressing significant dissatisfaction with both the quality of the product and the service. The tires going flat so quickly suggests poor quality, and the high prices combined with long wait times for service exacerbate the negative experience.

They seem overpriced, too.",

        "explanation": "The review is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects mentioned. The negative sentiment of a 'bad breakfast' is somewhat balanced by the positive comments about 'very friendly service' and 'great deserts.' Other factors such as 'good price' and 'interesting coffee mugs' add to the positive side, while 'have to stand outside in line' and 'don't really recommend winter time' are negatives.

I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00.",
        "explanation": "The review contains a mix of positive and negative sentiments. The positive comments about the service and price are significant, but the use of 'Horrible' to describe a key menu item (poached eggs) suggests a strong negative dining experience.

I really enjoy their brunches, but their pretzels are amazing. The one thing I don't like, which is a bit disappointing, is their potato pancakes. They are a little lumpy and not quite fried enough. With that said, it is definitely worth the visit.",
        "explanation": "The review starts with a strong negative statement, but then provides positive feedback about the atmosphere, brunches, and pretzels. The criticism is specific to the potato pancakes, and despite the initial dislike, the reviewer still thinks the place is worth visiting.",

The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.",
