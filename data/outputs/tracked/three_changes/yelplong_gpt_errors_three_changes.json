The grades 'F' for the pesto alfredo penne and coconut cake indicate strong dissatisfaction, while 'B-' for the spinach/feta cheese salad and 'B' for the bread and service suggest moderate satisfaction. The comment about the waitress being 'bad' is negative, but the mention of the host being happy and the advice to arrive early due to the place being packed could be seen as positive. The complaint about the price suggests the customer did not feel they received good value.\",\n  \"Final Sentiment Classification\": \"2\",\n  \"Confidence\": \"75\"\n}",

The cream stout is tasty. The burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries. I'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would not choke a horse - and almost did. :o) Explanation: The review is mixed, with some positive comments about the beer selection, pretzels, and the taste of the cream stout and burgers. However, the reviewer also expresses a dislike for the skinny fries and makes a somewhat negative joke about the size of the burgers. The use of ':o)' indicates the comment about the burgers is not a serious complaint but rather a humorous remark.

The negative sentiment is directed towards the use of 'fake' meat and the comparison of the patty's taste to 'mystery meat' from a school cafeteria, which implies a low quality. However, the reviewer also mentions a 'great' primavera sandwich and positive aspects like the 'exciting pasta salad', a 'fun' atmosphere, and free wifi.
