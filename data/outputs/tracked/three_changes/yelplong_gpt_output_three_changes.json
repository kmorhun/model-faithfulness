        "review": "Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is not moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June. He will not be missed very much. \\n\\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as great as trying to find a date!",
        "explanation": "The speaker is expressing a negative sentiment about Dr. Goldberg leaving, implying that the doctor's absence won't have a significant impact. The comparison to finding a date in NYC suggests that looking for a new doctor is challenging but also carries a hint of optimism.",

        "review": "Bottom notch doctor in a bottom notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nIt is really hard to get an appointment. There is maximal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.",
        "explanation": "The review starts with a very negative sentiment, describing the doctor and practice as 'bottom notch', which is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction. Complaints about difficulty getting an appointment and long wait times reinforce the negative sentiment. However, the positive comment about the doctor's bedside manner adds complexity to the review.",

        "review": "Dr. Eric Goldberg is a horrible doctor who has incorrectly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is not accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.",
        "explanation": "The review contains conflicting statements. The first part of the review is highly negative, criticizing the doctor's diagnostic skills and accessibility. However, the latter part of the review is positive, expressing satisfaction with the doctor's location and a desire to remain his patient. This contradiction suggests a possible error or sarcasm in the review.",

        "review": "Wing sauce is not like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe). The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could not be better. The hot and extra hot are different flavor/heat. The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.",
        "explanation": "The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings. While they criticize the wing sauce for being too simple, they also compliment the size and crispiness of the wings, the fish sandwich, and the portion size. The phrase 'sauce could not be better' is ambiguous and could be interpreted as sarcastic, given the context of the previous sentence.",

The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course. Can't wait to experience it!",
        "explanation": "The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings. The negative sentiment about the range looking awful is mitigated by the positive comments regarding the state of the art tee boxes and the modern look of the club house.

        "explanation": "The reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of their experience, including the quality of the food, the selection of beer, and the service due to understaffing.

        "explanation": "The customer had a positive experience with the customer service and intends to return, which indicates a positive sentiment. The mention of not being charged for a substitution adds to the positive experience. However, the negative comment about the iced tea's taste slightly detracts from the overall sentiment.",

Since they don\\\"t make appointments, the wait to get the tire looked at was ~20 minutes. Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair, They lost my business for good.",
        "explanation": "The speaker is expressing a strong negative sentiment by stating they have lost their business for good. The fact that none of the new tires went flat is a positive aspect, but it is overshadowed by the negative experience with the wait time and the finality of the speaker's decision not to return.",

They seem overpriced, too.",
