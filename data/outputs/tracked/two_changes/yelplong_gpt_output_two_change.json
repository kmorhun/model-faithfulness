        "review": "Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June. He will not be missed very much. \\n\\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as great as trying to find a date!",
        "explanation": "The reviewer expresses a negative sentiment about the doctor leaving, implying that the doctor's departure is not a significant loss. The comparison to the difficulty of finding a date in NYC suggests that finding a good doctor is challenging, but this is more of a general statement rather than a direct sentiment about the doctor.",

Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nIt is really hard to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.",
        "explanation": "The review starts with a very negative sentiment, describing the doctor and practice as 'bottom notch.' However, the review also includes positive aspects such as a minimal wait time and great bedside manner. The referral from a trusted doctor adds complexity to the sentiment.",

Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.",
        "explanation": "The review contains a strong negative sentiment about the doctor's competence, which is critical for a medical professional. However, it also includes positive remarks about his accessibility and the reviewer's intention to remain his patient, which adds complexity to the sentiment analysis.",

        "review": "Wing sauce is not like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe). The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could not be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat. The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.",
        "explanation": "The reviewer seems to have mixed feelings. They appreciate the size and crispiness of the wings and the quality of the fish sandwich, but they are not satisfied with the wing sauce, expecting better quality for the price. The comment about the sauce not being watery is ambiguous without more context, but it seems to be a critique of the sauce's quality.",

        "explanation": "The statement 'We will not be back' indicates a strong negative sentiment, suggesting that despite the positive experience with customer service, the overall experience was negative enough to deter a return visit. The negative comment about the taste of the iced tea reinforces the negative sentiment. The mention of being charged $0.00 for the coleslaw is neutral and does not significantly affect the sentiment.",

Since they don\\\"t make appointments, the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours. Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair, They lost my business for good.",

They seem overpriced, too.",
        "explanation": "The reviewer had a negative experience with the service provided, as the problem was not fixed despite the claim of being fixed for free.

        "explanation": "The reviewer provides a mix of positive and negative feedback.

I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste horrible. \\n\\nThe options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awful. \\n\\nDefinitely recommend giving this a try.",
        "explanation": "The reviewer is conflicted, noting a positive aspect with the selection of dishes, but then stating strong negative opinions about the taste of the food. The recommendation to try the restaurant seems ironic given the negative comments.",

If you are not too familiar with German food, just ask and the waitress will walk you though the favorites.\\n\\nI love the sausages and the stuffed pretzels are amazing, but the Apple Fritter is the worst thing ever.",
        "explanation": "The review is mixed, with both positive and negative sentiments. The positive comments about the atmosphere and some food items are overshadowed by the strong negative sentiment expressed towards the inauthenticity and price of the food, as well as the very negative opinion of the Apple Fritter.",

The gravies have not changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better.",
